RBTree's properties:
1) Each node is either black or red
2) The root node is black
3) The NILL node is black
4) no adjacent red nodes
5) From each node every simple path has equal number of black nodes

bh(x) -> black node height
bh(x) >= h(x) / 2

Black nodes count >= red nodes count for every subtree

Every subtre rooted at x has at least 2^bh(x) - 1 (proof with math induction theorem)

h(root) <= 2*log(n + 1)
